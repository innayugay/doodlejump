# Doodle Jump

[Live on Github Pages](https://kevinmoore9.github.io/doodlejump/)

This here is my own rendition of the classic mobile game, DoodleJump. It is built using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. All credit of the gameplay goes to the creator. All of the code, however, is my own.

## Features

The main focus of the application is the JavaScript recreation of the classic mobile game, DoodleJump. Unlike the original released on the iPhone, this version uses the keyboard arrow keys to control your character. In addition to the gameplay, there are also a few added features to note:

* Select from the characters on the right to change your jumper
*
* Links to my personal LinkedIn and Github pages

## Technology

My implementation of Doodle Jump uses a variety of technologies in it's implementation including:

* Node.js
* HTML5
* Canvas API
* CSS 3
* Webpack

## Future Additions

While a complete and entertaining game, this rendition of DoodleJump is still a growing project with new changes to come, including:

* Add new background themes / characters
* Create new block types including breakable blocks and blocks with springs
* Add music that coincides with the gameplay
